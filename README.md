# 2D FEM Thermal Solver

This repository contains a Python-based 2D Finite Element Method (FEM) solver for thermal analysis, designed to solve heat transfer problems. The project demonstrates efficient computation of local stiffness matrices and handling of various boundary conditions in computational simulations.

## Features
- Solves 2D thermal problems using the Finite Element Method (FEM).
- Generates local stiffness matrices for each element.
- Handles Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions.
- Modular design for extensibility and scalability.
- Visualization of temperature distribution (using optional plotting libraries).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib` (optional, for visualization)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Christian3-9/2D-FEM-Thermal-Solver.git
